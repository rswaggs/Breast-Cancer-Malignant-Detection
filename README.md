# Breast-Cancer-Malignant-Detection

As part of our clincial decision support course (computer science), we are tasked with creating a system to assist healthcare professionals. For our system, we aim to use [UCI Irvine Machine Learning Repository's breast cancer dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer) to detect if patients have malignant cancer. 

Key features:
- Patient record system. Essentially hold data about patients with easy display and access.
- Classification algorithm (input form of required features, outputs binary outcome)
- Visually display breakdown of algorithmâ€™s decision. In addition to confidence measure of whether cancer is spreading.
- Ability to upload new datasets, or concatenate with existing datasets and retrain for possible greater results.
- Version control for trained models. Ability to go back to a old model quickly, delete models not in use after sometime.
